# Arella Saikumar Yadav – Portfolio (React UMD)

This portfolio is built with React (UMD via CDN), so **no build step is required**. Just host these static files.

## Structure
- `index.html` – the app
- `assets/Arella_Saikumar_Yadav_Resume.pdf` – downloadable resume

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo and upload these files (ensure `index.html` is at the root).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/ (root)`.
3. Open the live URL.

## Deploy (Vercel/Netlify)
- Import the repo and deploy as a static site.
